# Bamazon
A full-stack app that mocks an ecomerce website. Uses a database to serve product info. 

Click on buy and the product is added to the cart. The inventory decrements from the database. If the product does not have sufficient quantities then there is an alert which shows insufficient quantity. 

This app was build with javascript/jquery, node.js., express.js, mySql and Sequelize. UI made pretty with html, Css, and bootstrap4.
